This is a basic RPG template, designed to distill some of my Phaser (JS) experience into a playable "game".
I wanted to provide this to the world, as a launchpad for HTML5 gaming.

The foundation of this template is found here:

3. From a terminal, go into the folder where the files are
4. run: "npm install"
5. once that's done, update it by running "npm audit fix"
6. once that's done, start it by running "npm run start"
